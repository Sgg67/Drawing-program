This is a project that I did in my Assembly class, where I made a drawing program in mips, 
which is a language similar to assembly. My program has a function to draw, fill in your drawing by pushing f on the keyboard. 
Also you can pull up a color pallette by pressing c and choose a color to draw in by clicking the mouse. Last but not lest you can draw lines, 
by holding shit.
